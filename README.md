# This project implements a RAG-based chatbot designed to handle topic-specific queries while maintaining conversation context. It leverages advanced AI technologies for embeddings, prompt engineering, and query processing to optimize response accuracy and relevance.

# Technologies Used

# 1. Language Model
**LLM Used: Biomistral 7B**
Biomistral 7B was chosen for its efficient performance on domain-specific tasks, particularly in healthcare and technical domains. It provides a fine balance of speed and accuracy, making it suitable for maintaining conversation context while delivering nuanced responses.

# 2. Embeddings
**Model: NeuML/pubmedbert-base-embeddings**
This model was selected due to its focus on biomedical and technical domains, aligning well with chatbot tasks such as handling healthcare and cybersecurity queries. The embeddings generated by PubMedBERT improve semantic understanding in these areas, supporting accurate document retrieval.

# 3. Vector Database
**Database: Qdrant**
Qdrant is utilized for storing vectorized text chunks and for efficiently retrieving relevant information based on user queries. Its support for scalable similarity search optimizes the retrieval process, enabling fast and accurate responses. Qdrantâ€™s open-source, high-performance framework makes it a natural choice for handling the vectorized data in RAG systems.

# 4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG combines the power of a vector database with an LLM to enhance the chatbot's response capabilities. By embedding data and retrieving relevant information, RAG enables the chatbot to provide more precise, contextually relevant answers, especially when answering domain-specific queries.

# 5. Advanced Prompt Engineering
Advanced prompt engineering is employed to improve response quality and consistency. This includes:
Prompt Templates: Domain-specific prompt templates for query types such as summarization and Q&A.
Few-Shot Learning: Adding 2-3 examples per template to ensure consistent output.
Techniques: Experimenting with strategies like chain-of-thought and self-consistency to guide the LLM in generating accurate responses.

# 6. Query Processing with AI
**TextBlob: Used for query preprocessing, including:**
Spell Correction: Automatically corrects typos or misspelled words in user queries.
Query Classification: Differentiates between "summary" and "general" queries based on keywords to improve the response focus.
